      <p>Scottish fried chicken is a delicious dish that has a long history and a unique flavor. According to some sources, Scottish immigrants introduced fried chicken to the American South in the 17th or 18th century1. They used vinegar, spices and lard to marinate and fry the chicken, creating a crispy and tangy dish. Some traditional Scottish recipes for fried chicken include chicken stovies, which is a casserole with potatoes, onions and chicken, and deviled chicken, which is coated with a spicy sauce made of jam, mustard, cayenne and garlic. You can find these recipes and more on the links below. Do you want to try any of them?</p>

        <p>Fried chicken is a popular dish in the US that many people enjoy for its delicious taste and satisfying crunch. Fried chicken tastes good because of the chemistry of frying, which creates a contrast between the crispy coating and the tender meat. The crispness also signals to our brain that the food is fresh and safe to eat. Fried chicken also appeals to our evolutionary response to foods that are high in fat, protein, and salt, which provide us with energy and nutrients.</p>

        <p>Chinese fried chicken is a delicious dish that can be made in different ways. Some common ingredients are soy sauce, garlic, ginger, wine, cornstarch, and eggs. The chicken can be marinated, coated, and fried until crispy and golden. Some recipes also add chili sauce, honey, ketchup, or cumin for extra flavor. Chinese fried chicken is good because it is simple, tasty, and satisfying. You can enjoy it as an appetizer or with rice and vegetables as a main course.</p>

              <hr>
              <p> Choosing the perfect bedding is another crucial factor to consider. Bedding serves a variety of purposes, besides comfort, such as odour control and a place for chickens to lay their eggs. If you plan on bringing home baby chicks, it might be better to use something soft that can retain warmth, such as pine shavings. You can use shavings for chickens’ entire lives, but you will need to ensure that you change them regularly. Other types of bedding that chickens typically like include straw, sand, and recycled paper. These are all effective alternatives to shavings, but keep in mind that they will require special attention and consideration. </p>
